So here's how we're going to do this.

The Unix environment was originally developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs.

Was originally developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M.d. Mcllroy and J.F.Ossanna when they left the Multics mainframe project.

November 3, 1971 was the day UNIX was released to the world.

Today UNIX has been built upon, with many different flavors. (list a few examples)
Unix distros: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, Linux Mint


Welcome to the Command Line Interface a.k.a. the CLI.  
Here's where we'll introduce you to how things work around here.

Below is an example of what you'll be seeing when you open up bash.  If you've made it this far you can finish this tutorial!

So here's how the CLI is structured (generally; it can be modified but that's for another time.)


**					      **
**		[]$rm -f foo.txt	      **
**		 1   2  3    4		      **
**					      **

	1: Prompt
	2: Command
	3: Option
	4: Argument

Prompt:  This where commands are entered; it's where your dreams and desires can be translated into the UNIX interface (or where you spend hours to just get that one thing to work.  Don't worry, it's rewarding.)

Command: This specifies your command.  What are you trying to do?  This is where you define that.

Option:  Hey we want to be able to quickly customize some of the things we're trying to do, so this gives us that option.  Also, it's optional.

Argument: What or where are you trying to effect a change.  To what type of file or folder?  Not used for all commands.
