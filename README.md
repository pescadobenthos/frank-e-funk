project to getting a unix tutorial working

Welcome to this first public project of mine!

This project is to serve as my first contribution to github, as well as first git push / project.  It will not be organized in any certain way, and will likely appear very chaotic.

The goal here is to teach myself (and others) how to progress in the UNIX / LINUX / SH environment, specifically working in bash.

This will be a program designed to teach the command terminal from the ground up. 
Files will be edited in a nonsensical manner as it's my first attempt!  

As of right now, nothing is happening.  Check back in for updates
