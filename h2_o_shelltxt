How to output shell text:


first create your shell file, either by touch or by cat > {filename}

if by touch, ensure you rename with the ".sh" extension (by using mv)

Use the command result=`cat {filename}` to call files

Call result as follows: 
     echo $result

This will output your text file!  

Note: cat is usually only used for small snippets of text, 

to output larger text files ensure that a more appropriate call is used, such as vim

To call your shell script, use location (in our case it will be in a directory we've created)  
here's what we'll use to open it $./SHELL.SH *(shell filename)
