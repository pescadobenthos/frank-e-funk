How to use the 'sed' command:

sed is used to read lines of text, but is more powerful (and mistifying) than that!

to specify which lines you'd like to see, use commands such as:

To print 1 line 
$sed -n 5p file
LINE 5 HERE
where 5p represents the line that will be printed

to get multiple lines, use something like this
$sed -n -e 5p -e -8p file
LINE 5 HERE
LINE 8 HERE

for ranges it'll go as follows:
$sed -n 5,8p file
LINE 5
LINE 6
LINE 7
LINE 8

More complexity!  Range and line at the same time!
$sed -n -e 5,8p -e 10p file
LINE 5
LINE 6
LINE 7
LINE 8
LINE 10
     *note the lack of line 9 above.

sed command can also be used to modify the outputs of cat by piping `sed` 
commands
